# Network-Oriented-Contact-Management-System
This project is a Network-Based Phonebook Management System developed in C using TCP/IP socket programming. It follows a client–server architecture where operations like add, search, update, delete, list, and sort contacts are performed over a network. Contact data is stored persistently in a CSV file to ensure data consistency and easy access.
